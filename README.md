# Odin-Recipes

This is a README.md file for a recipe catalog website. The initial aim of this project is to develop a functional website that displays and catalogs recipes. However, as I progress and improve my coding skills, I plan to turn it into a showcase website to demonstrate my talents, skills, and capabilities.

## Goals

The primary goals of this project are as follows:

1. Develop a recipe catalog website to showcase various recipes.
2. Implement a user-friendly interface for browsing and searching recipes.
3. Create a simple and clean design for easy navigation.
4. Provide detailed recipe information, including text blocks about ingredients, instructions, and images.

## Dev Plan

0. notes above all I understand that this is an exercise in structuring and record keeping, I will show a commitment to rigid note keeping following this structure=

    Subject an explanation of the changes made

    body explaining why the change was needed


1. **Understanding the requirements:** I will look over the instructions for this assignment and the requirements, build a mockup of the website skeleton in my notes before I begin

2 **Quick build:** I will make a this readme file when I begin my build and when it is ready for presentation. for an accurate build time of the skeleton. I don't expect this speed will be anything special but it will make a good indicator of my rate of improvement over time.

3. **Enhancing visual design:** images will be sized to fit the text and may double as links

> coloring the bg off white F4F6F7 for bg and 1B2631 for text
> centering the text  
> use h1 for main underlined, 2 for recipes 4 for each list

4. **Template** I will make a simple layout template page that can be used for any recipe and copy it twice before ever filling it out

5. **navigation** for now there will be 4 directories in the root, 1 for each of the recipes and one for the images the index page will have a link to each of the recipes in a list format under the title. each recipe should have a link to the images of the dish.  in the future ill put the recipes in their own dir for cleanliness

6. **Implementing additional features:** Once the core functionality is complete, I will use the website as both a testing page and a catalogue of my various techniques. so that I can refer to it later for ideas, and so that others who see the page will know what I am experienced in

here are a few things id like to add

    > use text area command to put the recipes into a nice looking text box  maybe later 
    >homepage should have an odin icon maybe a button net to title 
    > I would like a portion calculator to tell you what how much of each ingredient you will need based on your p0lanned serving size 
    > id like the ingredients to pull nutrition facts from an outside web page and for that information to be hidden until the food is clicked. if im feeling ambitious id like clicking the food item to prompt a drop-down menu with the ingredients nutrition facts and an image it
     > clicking the image  item should take the user to either  link them to the wikI about that item or if possible take them to a page where t
hey can buy said food from a local store (would need location service) or from an app like insta cart

    >id like to trade out the list of recipes for a search bar 
    >id like to make a format through which people could submit recipes easily. this might also mean 
    >establishing a membership system 
    <obviously thats getting way into the weeds>

7. **experiment** I plan to use this site in the future to test new features. in the future

## Conclusion

Depending on how much time I have to spend on it. you may stumble across a website that looks completely different from other odin recipe pages. If so I encourage you to go back through my dev process and see its development. If not well I had some big ideas but the best laid plans as they say. and in the end I would really just be doing it for fun
